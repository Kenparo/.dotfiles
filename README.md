# .dotfiles
My dotfiles, mouseless (as much as possible) Void Linux+bpswm

OS : Void Linux
WM : bspwm
Browser : qutebrowser
Terminal Emulator : urxvt (trying termite on the next reinstall)
Image Viewer : pqiv
Wallpaper : setroot
Bar : polybar (default)

Planning to add/change:
  - Conky Overwatch-themed status
  - Customize polybar
  - Add keyboard bindings
  
What prevents me from going mouseless (exept for games) :
  - Qutebrowser doesnt support caret mode yet, waiting for an update
